## [](#header-2)About Me

I'm a recent graduate (May 2017) from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where I obtained my MSc in physics. The research projects that I was involved with included both theoretical and computational methods in cosmology, gravitational wave detection, and simulations of white dwarf binary mergers. I have included some more information about these topics in my [Research](research) page.

Before graduate school, I received my BS in physics (minor in mathematics) from the University of Pittsburgh. While an undergraduate there, I analyzed spectral images of galaxies for the DEEP3 survey in order to determine their redshifts and I also worked as a laboratory assistant in condensed matter research.

In addition to physics, I'm also interested in data science and machine learning. The links in the Projects section below have more information on the various data science projects that I have done in my own time as well as the various Kaggle competitions that I have participated in.
