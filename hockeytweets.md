# [](#header-1)Twitter Streaming of Eastern Conference Finals Game 7 between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Ottawa Senators

Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals was one of the most stressful games I've ever watched as a Penguins fan. No team has won back to back Stanley Cups in the salary cap era, and the Penguins stand a chance to be the first when they faceoff against the Nashville Predators. The last team to do it was the Detroit Red Wings in 97-98. Before that, the Pittsburgh Penguins in 91-92. 

I live streamed tweets in the moments leading up to the game and for the duration of the game, amassing a total of 15,208 tweets (64MB) with keywords: 'sidney crosby', 'pittsburgh penguins', 'ottawa senators', 'nhl playoffs', and 'stanley cup.'
