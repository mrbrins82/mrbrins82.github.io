# [](#header-1)Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

The sinking of the Titanic resulted in the loss of many lives. There were over 1500 deaths, accounting for approximately 2 out of every 3 people on the ship (passengers and crew combined). In this competition, Kaggle provides two data sets (a training set and a testing set) which contain numerical and categorical features for each of the passengers. The two sets contain the same numerical and categorical features, except that the training set also tells us if the passengers survived. The objective is to use the data to predict whether or not passengers in the testing data set survived or not.

The features contained in the data sets are:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th><b>Feature</b></th>
    <th><b>Description</b></th>
    <th><b>Key</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Survived</td>
    <td>Passenger deceased/survived</td>
    <td>deceased = 0, survived = 1</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Pclass</td>
    <td>Social class of passenger</td>
    <td>1st = 1, 2nd = 2, 3rd = 3</td>
