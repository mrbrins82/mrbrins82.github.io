## [](#header-2)About Me

I'm a recent graduate (May 2017) from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where I obtained my MSc in physics. The research projects that I was involved with included both theoretical and computational methods in cosmology, gravitational wave detection, and simulations of white dwarf binary mergers. I have included some more information about these topics in my [Research](research) page.

In addition to physics, I'm also interested in data science and machine learning. My [Kaggle](kaggle), and [Projects](projects) pages have more information on the various Kaggle competitions that I have participated in and projects that I done on my own time.
